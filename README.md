### ExpressStart

The idea is simple, ExpressStart is just a CLI tool that helps you scaffold a new express project by selecting dependency options.

Setting up new express projects a lot of times come off as an headache when not done properly or there's just a lot of packages that does the same thing
in the project setup but are configured differently (it's annoying I know), so I built this to quickly scaffold a new express project as fast as you can create a new Next.js project, just few clicks and selections and you're done!.

#### To install ExpressStart?

It's very easy, just run

```ts
  npm install -g create-exstart
```

#### Check installation
```ts
create-exstart --version
```

#### And to use it....

Run this command and use the wizard to setup your project

```ts
  npx create-exstart <project-name>
```
